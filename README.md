# Moving robot navigated by LIDAR camera

# Description of the project 
A robot that moves in the direction where the distance to the nearest obstacle is greatest. Based on a previous project https://github.com/ComplexityGarage/Lidar

The principle of this project is simple. LIDAR camera is placed on a servo. When it rotates, the distanes between camera and nearest object are measured depending on the angle. After a full rotation the measurements are compared, and the angle for which the distanse was greatest is saved. Then the motor is turning in that direction. After some time this procedure repeats.



# Science and tech used 
## Metal chaissis 2WD
A metal platform with two DC motors. In configuration with raspberry pie it allows to make a fully controlled 2-wheel robot.

## Other:
a breadboard; KORAD DC power supply; a lot of wires; self-made wooden "floors" which allowes to fit all parts on the chaissis (floors.jpg)
# State of the art 
A circuit (circuit_test.jpg) and the code and are going to be based on the tutorials (https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/projects/make-obstacle-avoiding-robot-raspberry-pi) and (https://diyprojectslab.com/raspberry-pi-with-l298n-driver/)
